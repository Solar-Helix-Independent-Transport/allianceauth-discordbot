command=/home/allianceserver/venv/auth/bin/python /home/allianceserver/myauth/bot_conf.py
directory=/home/allianceserver/myauth
user=allianceserver
numprocs=1
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopwaitsecs=600
stdout_logfile=/home/allianceserver/myauth/log/authbot.log

## Using AA-Discordbot from my project

### Send Messages
[aadiscordbot/tasks.py](https://github.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-discordbot/blob/master/aadiscordbot/tasks.py)

```python
## Use a small helper to check if AA-Discordbot is installs
def discord_bot_active():
    return 'aadiscordbot' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS

## Only import it, if it is installed
if discord_bot_active():
    import aadiscordbot.tasks

## These two tasks can be called to Queue up a Message
## AA Should not act on these, only AA-DiscordBot will consume them
if discord_bot_active():
    aadiscordbot.tasks.send_direct_message_by_user_id.delay(user_pk, message_content)
    aadiscordbot.tasks.send_direct_message_by_discord_id.delay(discord_user_id, message_content)
    aadiscordbot.tasks.send_channel_message_by_discord_id.delay(channel_id, message_content, embed=False)
```

### Register Cogs (Handling Commands)

In `auth_hooks.py`, define a function that returns an array of cog modules, and register it as a `discord_cogs_hook`:
```python
@hooks.register('discord_cogs_hook')
def register_cogs():
    return ["yourapp.cogs.cog_a", "yourapp.cogs.cog_b"]
```
