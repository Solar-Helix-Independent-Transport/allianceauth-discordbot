## Route AA Discord bot tasks away from AllianceAuth
app.conf.task_routes = {'aadiscordbot.tasks.*': {'queue': 'aadiscordbot'}}
```

* Run migrations `python manage.py migrate` (There should be none from this app)
* Gather your static files `python manage.py collectstatic` (There should be none from this app)

* Fetch `bot_conf.py` from the Git Repo into the root of your AA install, beside `manage.py`

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-discordbot/master/bot_conf.py
```

* Amend your supervisor.conf, correcting paths as required and add `authbot` to the launch group at the end of the conf

```ini
[program:authbot]
command=/home/allianceserver/venv/auth/bin/python /home/allianceserver/myauth/bot_conf.py
directory=/home/allianceserver/myauth
user=allianceserver
numprocs=1
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopwaitsecs=600
stdout_logfile=/home/allianceserver/myauth/log/authbot.log
stderr_logfile=/home/allianceserver/myauth/log/authbot.log
```

```ini
#This block should already exist, add authbot to it
[group:myauth]
programs=beat,worker,gunicorn,authbot
priority=999
```

Go to admin and configure your admin users in the bot config model.

> Enable groups/states/users to utilize the lookup command by adding permissions under **corputils | corp stats |**
```ini
corputils.view_alliance_corpstats
```

## Reaction Roles
> ❗❗❗ **This will bypass the Group Leadership/Join Request System**: This is intended for open groups but not limited to it! ❗❗❗

The bot is able to run a reaction roles system that is compatible with auth and public users on a discord.
 - If a member is part of auth it will do auth syncing of roles
 - If a member is not found in auth and the reaction role message has the public flag set it will assign roles to anyone who reacts

### How To Reaction Role!
 1. Setup the inital Message you wish to use buy using the command !rr
   - *Optional* Edit the name and settings of this message in `Admin > Discord Bot > Reaction Role Messages`
 2. React to the message with the reactions you wish to use.
 3. The bot will counter react to the reactions when it creates the binding in auth.
 4. Goto `Admin > Discord Bot > Reaction Role Bindings`
 5. Assign the groups you want for each reaction

## Integrations
* [Statistics](https://github.com/pvyParts/aa-statistics)
  * Adds zkill Monthly/Yearly stats to !lookup
* [timezones](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-timezones)
  * Updates the `time` command to have all timezones configured in auth.

## Welcome Messaages
`
With the WelcomeGoodbye Cog activated, Discordbot will grab a random message from the Welcome or Goodbye Message Model and send it to the Guild System channel

These can be configured in admin under `/admin/aadiscordbot/welcomemessage/` and `/admin/aadiscordbot/goodbyemessage/`

The messages support some string formatting

* `{user_mention} - A Discord @ Mention
* `{guild_name} - The name of the Discord Server
* `{auth_url} - A link to Auth
```
Welcome {user_mention} to {guild_name}, I hope you enjoy your stay.

You can Authenticate for more access {auth_url}
```

## Using AA-Discordbot from my project

### Send Messages
You can use the send_message helper to send a message with text/embed to:
  - Discord user_id
  - Discord channel_id
  - Auth User Model Object
  - Auth user_pk

[aadiscordbot/tasks.py](https://github.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-discordbot/blob/master/aadiscordbot/tasks.py)

### Example Usage
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.apps import apps

## Use a small helper to check if AA-Discordbot is installs
def discord_bot_active():
    return apps.is_installed('aadiscordbot')

## Only import it, if it is installed
if discord_bot_active():
    from aadiscordbot.tasks import send_message
    # if you want to send discord embed import them too.
    from discord import Embed, Color

## this helper can be called to Queue up a Message
## AA Should not act on these, only AA-DiscordBot will consume them
if discord_bot_active():
    usr = User.objects.get(pk=1)

    # discord ID of user
    msg = "Channel ID Tests"
    e = Embed(title="Channel ID Tests!",
              description="This is a Test Embed.\n\n```Discord Channel ID```",
              color=Color.yellow())
    e.add_field(name="Test Field 1", value="Value of some kind goes here")
    send_message(channel_id=639252062818926642, embed=e) # Embed
    send_message(channel_id=639252062818926642, message=msg) # Message
    send_message(channel_id=639252062818926642, message=msg, embed=e) # Both

    # Discord ID of channel
    msg = "User ID Tests"
    e = Embed(title="User ID Tests!",
              description="This is a Test Embed.\n\n```Discord User ID```",
              color=Color.nitro_pink())
    e.add_field(name="Test Field 1", value="Value of some kind goes here")

    send_message(user_id=318309023478972417, embed=e) # Embed
    send_message(user_id=318309023478972417, message=msg) # Message
    send_message(user_id=318309023478972417, message=msg, embed=e) # Both

    # User model
    msg = "Auth User Model Tests"
    e = Embed(title="Auth User Model Tests!",
              description="This is a Test Embed.\n\n```Auth User Model```",
              color=Color.dark_orange())
    e.add_field(name="Test Field 1", value="Value of some kind goes here")
    send_message(user=usr, embed=e) # Embed
    send_message(user=usr, message=msg) # Message
    send_message(user=usr, message=msg, embed=e) # Both

    # User PK id
    msg = "Auth User PK Tests"
    e = Embed(title="Auth User PK Tests!",
              description="This is a Test Embed.\n\n```Auth User PK```",
              color=Color.brand_green())
    e.add_field(name="Test Field 1", value="Value of some kind goes here")
    send_message(user_pk=1, embed=e) # Embed
    send_message(user_pk=1, message=msg) # Message
    send_message(user_pk=1, message=msg, embed=e) # Both

    # Mixture of all of the above
    msg = "All Together Tests"
    e = Embed(title="All Together Tests!",
              description="This is a Test Embed.\n\n```All Together```",
              color=Color.blurple())
    e.add_field(name="Test Field 1", value="Value of some kind goes here")
    send_message(channel_id=639252062818926642,
                user_id=318309023478972417,
                user=User.objects.get(pk=1),
                message=msg,
                embed=e)
```

### Registering 3rd Party Cogs (Handling Commands)

In `auth_hooks.py`, define a function that returns an array of cog modules, and register it as a `discord_cogs_hook`:
```python
@hooks.register('discord_cogs_hook')
def register_cogs():
    return ["yourapp.cogs.cog_a", "yourapp.cogs.cog_b"]
```

## Optional Settings
### Isolate AuthBot from Auth's Discord Service
```python
AUTHBOT_DISCORD_APP_ID = 'App ID for dedicated bot'
AUTHBOT_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = 'Token for dedicated bot'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Py-Cord and discord.py fighting in venv
**Problem:**

Something has gone funny with my venv after i installed another app that wanted `discord.py`

**Reason:**

This is due to the Py-cord lib sharing the `discord` namespace. Py-Cord is however a drop in replacement. So no issues should arise from using it over the now legacy discord.py lib. **YMMV**

**Fix:**
 1. Uninstall `discord.py` by running `pip uninstall discord.py` with your venv active.
 2. Reinstall `py-cord` by running `pip install -U py-cord==2.0.0b3` with your venv active.
 3. Approach the dev from the app that overrode your py-cord to update to a maintained lib.
